A stronger torch for Necesse.

Check out the [Steam workshop page for the mod.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311404008)

### I'm not an artist, so if you want to submit a better texture for my mod I may accept it :)
Here's the current textures and how to submit a new one:
- [Torch object textures, ON and OFF versions](https://github.com/bolo422/necesse-mod-better-torch/tree/main/src/main/resources/objects)
- [Torch item texture (current the same as object)](https://github.com/bolo422/necesse-mod-better-torch/blob/main/src/main/resources/items/bettertorch.png)
- [Mod cover (Steam workshop icon)](https://github.com/bolo422/necesse-mod-better-torch/blob/main/src/main/resources/preview.png)
- My discord for your submission: `bolo422` (you can also make a pull request on github if you know how to do it)
